## Dataset
The training of the machine learning models in this project was able thanks to data provided in the  
"BIG IDEAs Lab Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device Data" dataset,  which you can be found [here](https://physionet.org/content/big-ideas-glycemic-wearable/1.1.1/#description).

## Backlog  
1. Create Binarization, Normalization and PCA Cpp functions to process the new data readings before applying model prediction.
